# Recurring Events Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Document Metadata

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-11-01
- **Author**: PRD Creator Agent
- **Status**: Approved

## 1. Overview

### Purpose

Enable users to create, view, edit, and delete calendar events that recur at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), eliminating the need to manually create repetitive events and improving calendar management efficiency.

### Value Proposition

**User Benefits:**
- Reduce time spent creating repetitive events from minutes to seconds
- Maintain consistency across recurring event series
- Visually identify recurring events at a glance
- Flexible control over editing/deleting single instances vs. entire series

**Business Benefits:**
- Increase user engagement through improved workflow efficiency
- Reduce data entry errors for repetitive events
- Align with standard calendar application expectations

### Scope

**Included:**
- Repeat type selection (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) during event creation/editing
- Visual indicators (icons) for recurring events in calendar view
- Mandatory repeat end date specification (max: 2025-12-31)
- Edge case handling for monthly (31st) and yearly (Feb 29) recurrences
- Confirmation dialogs for editing/deleting with single vs. series options
- API integration with existing backend endpoints for recurring operations
- Automatic generation of event instances based on recurrence rules

**Excluded:**
- Advanced recurrence patterns (e.g., "every second Tuesday", "weekdays only")
- Custom recurrence intervals beyond daily/weekly/monthly/yearly
- Overlap detection for recurring events (explicitly disabled)
- Recurrence exceptions beyond single event deletion/editing
- iCalendar (RFC 5545) RRULE standard compliance

### Success Metrics

- 100% of recurring events display distinct visual indicators in calendar view
- 0 instances of monthly (31st) events appearing on months with fewer than 31 days
- 0 instances of Feb 29 events appearing on Feb 28 in non-leap years
- 100% of edit/delete operations on recurring events show confirmation dialogs
- API response time for recurring event operations <2 seconds for series up to 365 instances

## 2. User Stories

### Must-Have Stories

**US-001**: As a calendar user, I want to select a repeat type (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) when creating an event, so that I don't have to manually create the same event multiple times.

**US-002**: As a calendar user, I want to see a visual icon on recurring events in the calendar view, so that I can immediately identify which events are part of a recurring series.

**US-003**: As a calendar user, I want to specify a repeat end date (max 2025-12-31), so that I can control how long the recurrence continues.

**US-004**: As a calendar user creating a monthly recurring event on the 31st, I want events to appear only in months with 31 days, so that my billing cycle events occur on the correct day.

**US-005**: As a calendar user creating a yearly recurring event on Feb 29, I want events to appear only in leap years, so that my leap day birthday celebrations are accurate.

**US-006**: As a calendar user editing a recurring event, I want to choose between editing only the selected instance or the entire series, so that I have control over the scope of my changes.

**US-007**: As a calendar user deleting a recurring event, I want to choose between deleting only the selected instance or the entire series, so that I can remove exceptions or cancel the entire series.

**US-008**: As a calendar user, I want recurring events to not trigger overlap warnings, so that I'm not blocked from creating legitimate recurring patterns.

### Should-Have Stories

**US-009**: As a calendar user editing a single instance of a recurring event, I want the edited instance to lose its recurring icon, so that I can visually distinguish it from the series.

**US-010**: As a calendar user, I want clear error messages if I try to set a repeat end date beyond 2025-12-31, so that I understand the system limitations.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Repeat Type Selection UI

**FR-001.1**: The event creation/editing form MUST include a repeat type selector with the following options:
- None (default)
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Yearly

**FR-001.2**: The repeat type selector MUST be implemented as a dropdown/select element labeled "반복 유형" (Repeat Type).

**FR-001.3**: When repeat type is set to "None", no additional repeat configuration fields SHALL be displayed.

**FR-001.4**: When repeat type is set to any value except "None", the repeat end date field MUST become visible and required.

### FR-002: Repeat End Date Configuration

**FR-002.1**: The repeat end date field MUST be implemented as a date picker input labeled "반복 종료일" (Repeat End Date).

**FR-002.2**: The repeat end date field MUST enforce the following validation rules:
- Required when repeat type is not "None"
- Must be a date after the event start date
- Must not exceed 2025-12-31
- Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format

**FR-002.3**: If the user attempts to set a repeat end date beyond 2025-12-31, the system MUST display the error message: "반복 종료일은 2025년 12월 31일을 초과할 수 없습니다" (Repeat end date cannot exceed December 31, 2025).

**FR-002.4**: If the user attempts to set a repeat end date before or equal to the event start date, the system MUST display the error message: "반복 종료일은 시작일 이후여야 합니다" (Repeat end date must be after start date).

### FR-003: Recurring Event Generation Logic

**FR-003.1**: When a user saves an event with repeat type != "None", the system MUST generate individual event instances according to the following rules:

**Daily Recurrence:**
- Create one event instance for each day from start date to end date (inclusive)
- Example: Start 2025-01-01, End 2025-01-05, Daily → 5 events (Jan 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

**Weekly Recurrence:**
- Create one event instance for each week (same day of week) from start date to end date
- Example: Start 2025-01-06 (Monday), End 2025-01-27, Weekly → 4 events (Jan 6, 13, 20, 27)

**Monthly Recurrence:**
- Create one event instance for each month (same day of month) from start date to end date
- **CRITICAL**: If the event is on the 31st, ONLY create instances in months with 31 days
- Skip months where the day does not exist (e.g., Feb 31, Apr 31, Jun 31, Sep 31, Nov 31)
- Example: Start 2025-01-31, End 2025-04-30, Monthly → 2 events (Jan 31, Mar 31) - Feb 31 and Apr 31 are skipped

**Yearly Recurrence:**
- Create one event instance for each year (same month and day) from start date to end date
- **CRITICAL**: If the event is on Feb 29, ONLY create instances in leap years
- Skip non-leap years where Feb 29 does not exist
- Example: Start 2024-02-29, End 2026-03-01, Yearly → 1 event (Feb 29, 2024) - 2025 and 2026 are not leap years

**FR-003.2**: All generated event instances in a recurring series MUST share a unique `repeat.id` value (UUID v4 format).

**FR-003.3**: All generated event instances MUST have individual unique `id` values (UUID v4 format).

**FR-003.4**: The system MUST send a POST request to `/api/events-list` endpoint with an array of all generated event objects.

**FR-003.5**: Each event in the recurring series MUST contain the complete `repeat` object with:
- `type`: The selected repeat type
- `interval`: 1 (fixed value for this version)
- `endDate`: The specified repeat end date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `id`: The shared repeat.id for the series

### FR-004: Recurring Event Visual Indicator

**FR-004.1**: In the calendar month view, every event with `repeat.type !== 'none'` MUST display a recurring event icon.

**FR-004.2**: The recurring event icon MUST be visually distinct and placed consistently (e.g., top-right corner of event box or before event title).

**FR-004.3**: The recurring event icon SHOULD use a recognizable symbol (e.g., circular arrows, repeat symbol, or Material-UI RepeatIcon).

**FR-004.4**: The recurring event icon MUST have an accessible alt text or ARIA label: "반복 일정" (Recurring Event).

**FR-004.5**: In the calendar week view, recurring events MUST also display the same recurring event icon.

### FR-005: Edit Recurring Event Confirmation Dialog

**FR-005.1**: When a user clicks to edit an event where `repeat.type !== 'none'`, the system MUST display a confirmation dialog BEFORE opening the edit form.

**FR-005.2**: The confirmation dialog MUST display the message: "해당 일정만 수정하시겠어요?" (Do you want to edit only this event?).

**FR-005.3**: The confirmation dialog MUST provide two action buttons:
- "예" (Yes) - Edit only this event
- "아니오" (No) - Edit entire series

**FR-005.4**: The confirmation dialog MUST also include a "취소" (Cancel) button to abort the operation.

**FR-005.5**: If the user selects "예" (Yes - edit single event):
- Set a flag indicating single-event edit mode
- Open the event edit form with the selected event's data
- When the user saves:
  - Send PUT request to `/api/events/:id` for the single event
  - Set `repeat.type` to 'none' for this event
  - Remove `repeat.id` from this event
  - Keep `repeat.endDate` and `repeat.interval` cleared or set to default values
  - The event icon MUST be removed from this event in calendar view

**FR-005.6**: If the user selects "아니오" (No - edit entire series):
- Set a flag indicating series edit mode
- Open the event edit form with the selected event's data
- When the user saves:
  - Regenerate all events in the series based on updated data
  - Send PUT request to `/api/recurring-events/:repeatId` with the updated event data
  - All events in the series MUST be updated
  - All events MUST maintain their `repeat` configuration
  - The recurring icon MUST remain visible on all events in the series

**FR-005.7**: If the user selects "취소" (Cancel):
- Close the dialog
- Return to the calendar view with no changes

### FR-006: Delete Recurring Event Confirmation Dialog

**FR-006.1**: When a user clicks to delete an event where `repeat.type !== 'none'`, the system MUST display a confirmation dialog.

**FR-006.2**: The confirmation dialog MUST display the message: "해당 일정만 삭제하시겠어요?" (Do you want to delete only this event?).

**FR-006.3**: The confirmation dialog MUST provide two action buttons:
- "예" (Yes) - Delete only this event
- "아니오" (No) - Delete entire series

**FR-006.4**: The confirmation dialog MUST also include a "취소" (Cancel) button to abort the operation.

**FR-006.5**: If the user selects "예" (Yes - delete single event):
- Send DELETE request to `/api/events/:id` with the single event ID
- Remove only the selected event from the calendar view
- All other events in the series MUST remain visible with recurring icons

**FR-007.2**: Recurring events MAY overlap with other events (recurring or non-recurring) without triggering warnings or errors.

**FR-007.3**: This exemption applies to both:
- Initial creation of recurring event series
- Editing of recurring event series (entire series edit mode)

### FR-008: API Integration Requirements

**FR-008.1**: The frontend MUST call POST `/api/events-list` when creating recurring events, with request body:

### FR-009: Data Model Requirements

**FR-009.1**: The `RepeatInfo` interface in `src/types.ts` MUST include an optional `id` field:
```typescript
export interface RepeatInfo {
  type: RepeatType;
  interval: number;
  endDate?: string;
  id?: string; // Shared identifier for recurring series
}
```

**FR-009.2**: Events that are part of a recurring series MUST have `repeat.id` populated with a UUID v4 value.

**FR-009.3**: Events with `repeat.type === 'none'` MUST NOT have `repeat.id` populated.

## 7. Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

### EC-001: Monthly Recurring on Non-Existent Days

**Scenario**: User creates monthly recurring event on the 31st.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Jan 31 exists → Event created
- Feb 31 does not exist → Skip this month
- Mar 31 exists → Event created
- Apr 31 does not exist → Skip this month
- May 31 exists → Event created
- Jun 31 does not exist → Skip this month
- Jul 31 exists → Event created
- Aug 31 exists → Event created
- Sep 31 does not exist → Skip this month
- Oct 31 exists → Event created
- Nov 31 does not exist → Skip this month
- Dec 31 exists → Event created

**Validation**: System generates events ONLY for months with 31 days.

### EC-002: Yearly Recurring on Feb 29 (Leap Day)

**Scenario**: User creates yearly recurring event on Feb 29, 2024 with end date 2028-03-01.

**Expected Behavior**:
- 2024 is leap year (Feb 29 exists) → Event created
- 2025 is NOT leap year → Skip this year
- 2026 is NOT leap year → Skip this year
- 2027 is NOT leap year → Skip this year
- 2028 is leap year (Feb 29 exists) → Event created

**Validation**: System generates events ONLY on Feb 29 in leap years.

### EC-003: Repeat End Date Exactly on Max Date

**Scenario**: User sets repeat end date to exactly 2025-12-31.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Validation passes
- If start date is 2025-12-31 with daily recurrence, exactly 1 event created
- No error message displayed

**Validation**: System accepts 2025-12-31 as valid end date (inclusive boundary).

### EC-004: API Failure During Recurring Event Creation

**Scenario**: User submits recurring event form, but API returns 500 error.

**Expected Behavior**:
- System displays error message: "반복 일정 생성에 실패했습니다"
- No partial series is created (all-or-nothing)
- User remains on event creation form with data preserved
- User can modify and retry submission

**Validation**: Data integrity maintained on API failure.

### EC-005: Network Timeout During Series Update

**Scenario**: User edits entire recurring series, but network request times out.

**Expected Behavior**:
- System displays error message: "반복 일정 수정에 실패했습니다"
- Original series data remains unchanged
- User can retry operation

**Validation**: No partial updates occur on timeout.

### EC-006: Concurrent Edit of Same Recurring Event

**Scenario**: Two users attempt to edit the same recurring event simultaneously (entire series).

**Expected Behavior**:
- Backend applies last-write-wins strategy
- Second user's changes overwrite first user's changes
- Both users receive success confirmations
- Calendar reloads showing final state

**Note**: Conflict resolution strategy is backend implementation detail; frontend shows latest data after refresh.

### EC-007: Deleting Last Remaining Instance

**Scenario**: User has 5-event recurring series. User deletes 4 instances individually (single-delete), leaving 1 event. User deletes the last event.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Confirmation dialog still appears asking "해당 일정만 삭제하시겠어요?"
- If user selects "예": Only that event is deleted
- If user selects "아니오": System attempts to delete series, but only 1 event exists, so only that event is deleted
- Both options have same result in this edge case

**Validation**: System handles single remaining event gracefully.

### EC-008: Editing Series After Individual Edits

**Scenario**: User has 5-event recurring series. User edits event #3 individually (converts to single event). Later, user edits event #1 and selects "Edit entire series".

**Expected Behavior**:
- Series update affects only events #1, #2, #4, #5 (events with matching repeat.id)
- Event #3 remains unchanged (no longer part of series)
- Event #3 does not have recurring icon

**Validation**: Single-edited events are excluded from series operations.

### EC-009: Form Validation Before Series Generation

**Scenario**: User fills event form with invalid data (e.g., end time before start time) and selects daily recurrence.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Standard event validation errors appear
- Recurring event generation does NOT occur until all validation passes
- Submit button remains disabled
- User must fix validation errors before submission

**Validation**: Recurring logic does not bypass existing validation rules.

### EC-010: Large Recurring Series (365 Events)

**Scenario**: User creates daily recurring event for entire year (365 events).

**Expected Behavior**:
- System generates all 365 events
- API request completes within 2 seconds
- All events stored in backend
- Calendar view shows events for current month only (paginated view)
- Performance remains acceptable

**Validation**: System handles maximum realistic series size.

## 8. Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- **Backend API**: Existing endpoints for recurring operations:
  - POST /api/events-list
  - PUT /api/recurring-events/:repeatId
  - DELETE /api/recurring-events/:repeatId
  - PUT /api/events/:id (for single event conversion)
  - DELETE /api/events/:id (for single event deletion)

- **Frontend Libraries**:
  - Material-UI: Dialog, Select, DatePicker, Icon components
  - notistack: Snackbar notifications for errors
  - React 19: Hooks and component architecture

- **Utility Modules**:
  - src/utils/eventUtils.ts: Add recurring event generation logic
  - src/utils/dateUtils.ts: Date calculations for recurrence patterns
  - src/hooks/useEventOperations.ts: Extend for recurring CRUD operations

- **Type Definitions**:
  - src/types.ts: Update RepeatInfo interface to include optional id field

### Data Dependencies

- **Event Database**: Backend JSON files (realEvents.json, e2e.json) must support repeat.id field
- **Existing Events**: No migration required; existing events with repeat.type !== 'none' can be enhanced with repeat.id in future iterations

### Team Dependencies

- **Backend Team**: API endpoints already implemented (per CLAUDE.md)
- **Design Team**: No new designs required; using standard Material-UI components
- **QA Team**: Test cases and edge case scenarios documented in this PRD

## 9. Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

- **TC-001**: Maximum repeat end date is fixed at 2025-12-31 (system limitation)
- **TC-002**: Repeat interval is fixed at 1 (e.g., "every 1 day", "every 1 week") - no support for "every 2 weeks"
- **TC-003**: Recurring event generation is client-side (frontend generates array of events)
- **TC-004**: No iCalendar RRULE standard compliance
- **TC-005**: Recurring events do NOT support overlap detection (by design)

### Business Constraints

- **BC-001**: Korean language UI only for this iteration
- **BC-002**: Desktop browser support only (mobile out of scope)
- **BC-003**: No recurring event import/export in this iteration
- **BC-004**: No advanced recurrence patterns (e.g., "last Friday of month")

### Assumptions

- **A-001**: Users understand the difference between editing "this event" vs "all events"
- **A-002**: Backend API endpoints return responses within 2 seconds for series up to 365 events
- **A-003**: Backend correctly handles concurrent operations with appropriate locking or conflict resolution
- **A-004**: Browser local time zone handling is managed by existing date utility functions
- **A-005**: Existing event validation logic (time ranges, required fields) applies to recurring events
- **A-006**: Users will not create recurring events with start date after end date (validation prevents this)
- **A-007**: Backend generates UUID v4 IDs for both event.id and repeat.id
- **A-008**: Material-UI components provide sufficient accessibility features out of the box

### Risks and Mitigation

**Risk R-001**: Generating 365 event instances may cause performance issues.
- **Mitigation**: Implement performance testing with 365-event series; optimize generation algorithm if needed; consider backend-side generation in future iteration.

**Risk R-002**: Users may not understand the difference between "this event" and "all events" in confirmation dialogs.
- **Mitigation**: Use clear, concise Korean language; consider adding help text or tooltips; gather user feedback during testing.

**Risk R-003**: Monthly recurrence edge cases (31st) may confuse users when events are skipped.
- **Mitigation**: Document behavior clearly in user help; display notification explaining skipped months; consider showing warning when creating event on 31st.

**Risk R-004**: Yearly recurrence on Feb 29 may confuse users when events are skipped.
- **Mitigation**: Document behavior clearly in user help; display notification explaining leap year logic; consider showing warning when creating event on Feb 29.

**Risk R-005**: API failures may result in inconsistent state if some events are created/updated/deleted but not all.
- **Mitigation**: Backend implements transactional operations; frontend displays clear error messages; users can retry operations.

## 10. Out of Scope

- **Advanced Recurrence Patterns**: "Every second Tuesday", "Last Friday of month", "Weekdays only"
- **Custom Interval Values**: Interval > 1 (e.g., "Every 2 weeks", "Every 3 months")
- **Recurrence Exceptions**: Marking specific dates as exceptions within a series
- **Recurring Event Templates**: Saving recurring patterns for reuse
- **Bulk Edit Operations**: Editing multiple non-related recurring series at once
- **Drag-and-Drop Reschedule**: Dragging recurring events to new dates
- **Recurring Event Preview**: Showing all instances in a list before creation
- **Import/Export iCalendar**: Importing or exporting recurring events in .ics format
